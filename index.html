<h4>You've landed at the home page of Gabriel Joel Mitchell (gajomi) </h4>
I am a data scientist with a broad set of interests and a taste for adventure.
I enjoy hunting for good coffee in far away places and building sand castles
with youthful vigor and enthusiam. I am a confessed Wikipedia addict.
</p>

<p>
I was educated at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_University">
    Oregon State University </a>
where I received a Bachelor of Arts in computational physics. I continued my
education the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology">
    Georgia Institute of Technology</a>,
earning a Master of Science in physics and eventually a PhD in biology. I also
spent a short time a the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_British_Columbia">
    University of British Columbia </a>
as a summer student in mathematical biology.
</p>

<p> From 2013-2015 I was a postdoctoral scientist at the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Science_and_Technology_Austria">
    Institute of Science and Technology Austria</a>.
I am currently available for short term contract work on projects in
data analysis and scientific computing.
</p>

<p>
My area of expertise within data science revolves around time series analysis,
but I am also actively invovled in a number of software projects in different
areas of scientific computing. I am especially interested in the development of
software libraries and core infrastructure for the
<a href="http://julialang.org/"> Julia programming language</a>.

and recreational activities, <a href="/blog">ramblings </a> about topics in
data science and links to my
